# kraken-videochat

A simple webrtc based video chat developed for the krakenjs web application framework: https://github.com/paypal/kraken-js

This is not, by any means, production-ready software. I cannot guarantee that if you use this software bad things won't happen. These can range from the complete elimination of everything near and dear to you, to a sudden loss in your ability to spell. And anything else you can think of.

In other words, this repository is simply an experiment, a playground, to test how well the kraken framework plays with webRTC and sockets. Feel free to fork off this and do whatever you wish with it. The code here is issued as an open MIT open source license, at the end of this document.
